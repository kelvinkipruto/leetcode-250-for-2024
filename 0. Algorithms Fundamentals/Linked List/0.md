# Linked List

 

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

## Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains only one link field which points to the next node in the list.

```typescript
class Node {
    data: number;
    next: Node | null;

    constructor(data: number, next: Node | null = null) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }
}
```

1. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains two link fields which point to the next and the previous node in the list.

```typescript
class Node {
    data: number;
    prev: Node | null;
    next: Node | null;

    constructor(data: number, prev: Node | null = null, next: Node | null = null) {
        this.data = data;
        this.prev = prev;
        this.next = next;
    }
}
```

1. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points to the first node making a circular loop.

```typescript
class Node {
    data: number;
    next: Node;

    constructor(data: number, next: Node) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }
}
```

## Linked List vs Array

- **Memory Allocation**: In an array, memory is allocated during compile time, while in a linked list, it's allocated during runtime.
- **Memory Usage**: Linked list uses more memory than an array because of storage of additional next and prev references.
- **Insertion/Deletion**: Insertion and deletion of a node are faster in a linked list as compared to an array.
- **Accessing Elements**: Accessing elements in an array is faster, while it is slower in a linked list.

## Operations on Linked List

1. **Insertion**: You can insert a new node at the beginning, end, or any given position in the linked list.
2. **Deletion**: You can delete a node from the beginning, end, or any given position in the linked list.
3. **Traversal**: You can traverse through the linked list.
4. **Search**: You can search for a node in the linked list.
5. **Update**: You can update the value of a node in the linked list.

## Problems on Linked List

- **Easy**: Reverse a linked list, Find the length of a linked list, Delete a node from linked list.
- **Medium**: Detect a loop in a linked list, Remove loop in a linked list, Find the intersection point of two linked lists.
- **Hard**: Merge two sorted linked lists, Add two numbers represented by linked lists, Clone a linked list with next and random pointer.
