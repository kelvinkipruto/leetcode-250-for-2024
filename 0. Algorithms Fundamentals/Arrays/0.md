# Arrays

 

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

## Types of Arrays

1. **One-Dimensional Array**: This is the simplest type of array that uses a single index for its operations.

```typescript
let arr: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

1. **Multi-Dimensional Array**: An array of arrays is known as multi-dimensional array.

```typescript
let arr: number[][] = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]];
```

## Array vs Linked List

- **Memory Allocation**: In an array, memory is allocated during compile time, while in a linked list, it's allocated during runtime.
- **Memory Usage**: An array is memory-efficient. On the other hand, a linked list requires extra memory for storing pointers.
- **Insertion/Deletion**: Insertion and deletion of an element in an array is expensive as the room has to be created for the new elements and to delete an element is to create room for the new elements.
- **Accessing Elements**: Accessing elements in an array is faster, while it is slower in a linked list.

## Operations on Arrays

1. **Insertion**: You can insert an element at any given position in the array.
2. **Deletion**: You can delete an element from any given position in the array.
3. **Traversal**: You can traverse through the entire array.
4. **Search**: You can search for an element in the array.
5. **Update**: You can update the value of a particular element in the array.

## Problems on Arrays

- **Easy**: Find the maximum element in an array, Find the minimum element in an array, Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array.
- **Medium**: Reverse the array, Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array, Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s.
- **Hard**: Merge Overlapping Subintervals, Find the duplicate in an array of N+1 Integers, Set Matrix Zeroes.
